This Puppet module is extracted from [Chiselwrigt's puppet-postgresql repo](https://github.com/chiselwright/puppet-postgresql). That package does a lot of neat things, but I could never get it to work.

So I took the best concepts from it and pulled them into this minimalist package.

It has opinions.

It's meant specifically for Ubuntu Lucid,  for example.

It's also small enough you can fix it when something goes wrong (unlike the puppet-postgresql package) - even if you don't really know Puppet.
